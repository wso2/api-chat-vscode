# API Chat VS Code extension

This extension uses natural language to interact with APIs that have an OpenAPI description. When you enter a description of a scenario as the input to the API Chat extension in VS Code, it intelligently selects and calls the relevant resources for you.

## Usage

1. Open an OpenAPI YAML file in Visual Studio Code.
2. Click the **Open API Chat** button to open the API Chat Test Console.

Now, you are ready to use API Chat to test your API with the support of natural language and AI.

### Try out using already-available commands

Use any of the commands available in the API Chat Console to try out the API.

### Try out by Typing a Command in Natural Language

In the API Chat Console, type your command in natural language and API Chat will understand and execute it.
